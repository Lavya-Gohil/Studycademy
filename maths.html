    <h1>Calculus Notes</h1>

    <div class="content">

        <h2>1. Fundamental Concepts</h2>
        <p>Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities. It is divided into two main areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Differential Calculus</strong> - Concerned with rates of change (derivatives).</li>
            <li><strong>Integral Calculus</strong> - Concerned with accumulation of quantities (integrals).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Limits</h2>
        <p>The concept of a limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a particular point.</p>
        <h4>Limit Definition:</h4>
        <pre><code>lim x → a f(x) = L</code></pre>
        <p>As x approaches a, f(x) approaches L. This is the foundation of calculus.</p>

        <h2>3. Continuity</h2>
        <p>A function is continuous at a point if it is defined at that point, the limit exists at that point, and the limit equals the function's value at that point.</p>
        <h4>Continuity Conditions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>f(a) is defined.</li>
            <li>lim x → a f(x) exists.</li>
            <li>lim x → a f(x) = f(a).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Derivatives (Differential Calculus)</h2>
        <p>The derivative of a function measures the rate at which the function changes as the input changes. It is also the slope of the tangent to the function at a given point.</p>
        <h4>Derivative Definition:</h4>
        <pre><code>f'(x) = lim Δx → 0 [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx</code></pre>
        <p>This is the formal definition of a derivative. It represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function.</p>

        <h4>Geometrical Interpretation:</h4>
        <p>The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at a specific point.</p>

        <h4>Physical Interpretation:</h4>
        <p>The derivative represents the rate of change of a quantity, for example, velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time.</p>

        <h4>Common Rules of Differentiation:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Rule:</strong> If f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).</li>
            <li><strong>Sum Rule:</strong> If f(x) = g(x) + h(x), then f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x).</li>
            <li><strong>Product Rule:</strong> If f(x) = g(x) * h(x), then f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x).</li>
            <li><strong>Quotient Rule:</strong> If f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then f'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / [h(x)]^2.</li>
            <li><strong>Chain Rule:</strong> If f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Integrals (Integral Calculus)</h2>
        <p>Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. It is used to find the accumulated quantity, such as areas under curves or total change over time.</p>

        <h4>Basic Integral Rules:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant Rule:</strong> ∫ c dx = c * x + C, where c is a constant.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Rule:</strong> ∫ x^n dx = (x^(n+1)) / (n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Geometric Interpretation of Integration:</h4>
        <p>Integration calculates the area under the curve of a function. For example, the area under the graph of velocity over time gives the total distance traveled.</p>

        <h4>Definite vs. Indefinite Integrals:</h4>
        <p>A <strong>definite integral</strong> calculates the exact area under a curve between two limits, while an <strong>indefinite integral</strong> represents a family of functions and includes a constant of integration (C).</p>

        <h2>6. Applications of Calculus</h2>
        <p>Calculus has numerous applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimization: Finding maximum or minimum values of a function (e.g., maximizing profit, minimizing cost).</li>
            <li>Area and Volume: Calculating the area under curves and the volume of solids of revolution.</li>
            <li>Motion and Rates of Change: Understanding how quantities change over time (e.g., velocity, acceleration).</li>
            <li>Solving Differential Equations: Finding functions that satisfy relationships between quantities and their rates of change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Key Theorems and Concepts</h2>
        <h4>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:</h4>
        <p>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links the concept of differentiation and integration. It states that the derivative of an integral function is the original function, and the integral of a derivative function gives the net change of the function.</p>
        
        <h4>Mean Value Theorem:</h4>
        <p>The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on an open interval, there exists at least one point where the derivative of the function equals the average rate of change over the interval.</p>
